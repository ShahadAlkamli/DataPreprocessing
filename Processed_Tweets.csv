"7/7 Protecting our data and privacy is essential when using AI bots like ChatGPT. Many third-party extensions lack clear privacy policies, putting our information at risk. Let's stay cautious about who we trust with our data. #AI #PrivacyMatters #ChatGPT"
"6/7 Promptheus, another free #ChatGPT browser extension, has a stated #privacy policy that contradicts what they state in the Chrome Store. They collect and use data in every way imaginable, including selling it for advertising purposes."
"4/7 WritingMate, the #1 ChatGPT/GPT assistant, claims to be '100% #Privacy friendly,' but their policy seems like boilerplate where you trade off ownership of your data in exchange for a 'free' service. Is it worth sacrificing privacy for the convenience of an AI plugin?"
"1/7 Merlin by @foyerwork. #ChatGPT Assistant for All Websites, claims to not collect information from opened web pages, yet their log files collect sensitive data like IP addresses, browser types, and more. Is it worth risking search, email, and document privacy? #PrivacyMatters"""
